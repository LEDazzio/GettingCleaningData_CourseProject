##Overview

Additional information about the variables, data and transformations used in the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

##Data

Data can be obtained from: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

##Information Regarding Data Set

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers were selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.  The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

##Data Attributes

Each record in the data set:

1. Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
2. Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
3. A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
4. Its activity label.
5. An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


##Task #1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

After setting the source directory for the files, read into tables the data located in

- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

Assign column names and merge to create one data set.


##Task 2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

Create a logcal vector that contains TRUE values for the ID, mean and stdev columns and FALSE values for the others. Subset this data to keep only the necessary columns.


##Task #3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Merge data subset with the activityType table to inlude the descriptive activity names.


##Task #4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

Use gsub function for pattern replacement to clean up the data labels.


##Task #5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Per the project instructions, we need to produce only a data set with the average of each veriable for each activity and subject.
